## Requirements

- **Python version >3.10**
- [A Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)

    The API key should be added to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` entry in the `.env` file if it exists. If the file doesn't exists, either create the `.env` file with the same content as `.env_model` and fill the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` entry with the API key or directly fill the entry in the `.env_model` before running the app for the first time. 

### Setup

It is recommended to create a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # macOS / Linux
# or
.\.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
```

Then install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run

Start the application with:

```sh
python main.py
```

After launching, your browser will open with the app running.

## Parameters

### Using a translator
Since the reference text used for evaluating the user’s answer is generated by Gemini, it can be unreliable (especially when using less-common languages).

In an attempt to improve accuracy, this project includes optional support for the [DeepL tranlator](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator).

To enable it:

1.  go in the `config.json` file and set:

```json
 "use_deepl_translation": true
```
2. Get a DeepL API key: https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api

3. Add the API key to the `DEEPL_API_KEY` field in your `.env` file
(or in `.env_model` if `.env` does not yet exist).
